    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",

We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "The major strengths of Decision Tree models are that they are easy to use, run quickly, able to handle both categorical & numerical data, and graphically allow you to interpret the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3 What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The major weakness of Decision Trees is that it is highly prone to overfitting. One solution to this is to track its performance and prune the branches so that not too many features are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4 What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Decision Tree model is a good candidate for this problem as Decision Tree models are particularly adept at binary classification, however it may run into problems due to the number of features (especially all the iterations of native-country) so care will have to be taken with regards to feature selection.\n",

    "Q1Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",

    "Ensemble Methods are particularly good at predictive tasks, and due to their general purpose nature can be applied to many different situations. One real-world example of their application is making product recommendations to users, a specific example being the application of a gradient boosted decision tree model in the Netflix Prize competition on Kaggle (http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/GrandPrize2009_BPC_BellKor.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2 What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important advantage of using ensemble method is that it is very difficult for the model to overfit,because the model only improves as you increase the complexity of the model (e.g. Bagging; by building more and more independent estimators, the resulting average of the estimators will only improve).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3 What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The major weaknesses to do with Ensemble Methods are related to increased storage and computation. Since Ensemble Methods require multiple classifiers, there is a need for more storage for the classifiers which can be costly. In a simliar vein, all of the classifiers need to be processed, rather than just one, which means that the run time of the algorithm is higher.The space complexity and time complexity of the algorithm is high due to different type of algorithm used.\n",

The SVM was used to select the best set of variables to classify individuals into categories relating to whether they had different stages of diabetes (Classifcation Scheme 1 being diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes vs. pre-diabetes or no diabetes and Classification Scheme II being undiagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes vs. no diabetes).\n",

    "\n",
    "Q3 What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",

    "SVMs don't work well in large datasets because of the growing amount of time it takes to classify the data. They also don't work well when there's lots of noise, as SVMs can overfit to noise in the data.\n",

    "SVMs are strongly capable of classifying non-linear data which may prove useful in this dataset, but the main reason I chose the model was because I am curious to find out if this dataset is too large and has too many features for an SVM to perform successfully.

    "of the three model chosen,The best model based on accuracy and f-score is the adaboost classifier(ensemble learning).AdaBoost Classifier performed really well on the test set than decision tree and SVM.One flaw that i found out with Decision tree classifier is that it overfits the training data.SVM classifier takes too long to learn for large data like 30,000. It was also not able to produce an F-score on neither the training subset nor the testing subset - likely because it was unable to predict a positive class at all, which would make F1 equal to 0/0. For these reasons, and for the reason that the AdaBoost Classifier performs particularly well on questions of binary classification, it would appear to be the best model to choose for CharityML."

    "It was pretty close! I did not predict capital-loss being as strong a feature as capital-gain, and my first choice of Occupation didn't make the top 5, though all the rest made it (albeit in a different order). I think it makes sense that age, capital gain/loss, hours-per-week, and education-num would have a strong effect as I outlined above, though I would have expected education-num to have had a bigger effect than age. I do also have a hunch that the features importances function has a preference for numerical rather than categorical data."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
